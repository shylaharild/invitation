                                Shamanthan, born with the full name Shree Vishwa Shamanthan, was pretty much a shrill loudspeaker. As the youngest, Shamanthan is most thankful to his partent for the gift of one and only big brother. Both of them spent most of their time in exploring electronic gadgets ending up breaking them. This cultivated his interest on eletronics and he became a nerd. After his graduation from the University of Texas, Dallas with the master's degree in VLSI designing, he is a successful Physical Design Engineer working at Apple Inc, Cupertino, San Francisco, California. Shamanthan is adding to his vows a lifetime electronics guarantee to Krishnapriya, that he will be readily available 24/7 to troubleshoot... anything &amp; everything electrical &amp; electronic.</p>

                                Born in the temple city, Krishnapriya was the youngest and pampered kid with two loving and caring sisters. Being the youngest, she was enriched by her parents to light up all her dreams. She had passion towards computers and eye for technology which lead her to do Engineering in Computer Science. After her gradutation, she joined as a Java Developer in the tech giant - Tata Consultancy Services, Chennai. Though she was interested in technology, she was secretly interested in learnign her family business. This burning entrepreneurial spirit and eye for business knowledge drove her to come back  to Madurai and take care of her family business along with her parents. Krishnapriya is adding to her vows that she will forever allow a one-room “man-den” with it’s contents and décor subject to Shamanthan’s discretion while she uses the entire house for her entrepreneurial passions. </p>

                            <h2>HOW THEY MET</h2>
                            <p>While neither bride nor groom had met face to face until this year January, it was the parents who took a step to bring in those free birds into this beautiful marri(c)age. Everything started with Shamanthan complaning about his lonely lifestyle in US and how he misses everyone everyday. He kept fussing about it and asked mom &amp; dad to visit him occasionaly. Both of them busy with their school and business respectively, they decided to end is fuss by handing him over to Krishnapriya to deal with. When they met virtually for the first time through Skype, Shamanthan swears that it was love at first sight. Though we all know that it was the Biriyani that he had when he visited Krishnapriya's sister's house in California for a function. </p>

                            <p>After their engagement in the month of January 2017, it was hard to get both of them on call as most of the calls to either of them would end up busy or voicemail. It wasn't hard for them to find that they were made for each other and how inseparable they were. In no time, they discovered their true love hidden within themselves. The rest is history - they’ve shared some amazing chats, each other's thoughts, and now they’re ready to share the rest of their lives together, too.</p>
